# Collection of utilities

This is my collection of scripts that I use or ever used in Linux, mainly in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.


## Contents

There are call hierarchy viewer, string manipulation util, CSV manipulation util, tiny web server, process pool, such a "shortcut" but not a shortcut, decryptor, brute force generator, etc.


### Smali CTrace

Smali CTrace (pronounced _smali seh trace_) is like call tracer or call hierarchy viewer in common IDE, but it reads [smali](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali) instead of Java source code. Not only methods, it also lists classes and fields.

To get smali from an APK, you can use either smali or [Apktool](http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) which wraps smali. I prefer Apktool instead of smali directly.


### Other utils

- **cexec** execute programs/scripts concurrently with limit and queue a.k.a. process pool
- **chdelim** change text delimiter
- **csvmerge** merge/group rows in CSV file based on equivalent columns
- **csvunmerge** reverse of csvmerge
- **httpserver.py** simple HTTP server; can be used to transfer files with your colleague
- **nmap2csv** convert Nmap result to CSV (in case you forgot to use `-oA` option of Nmap)
- **nmapfilter.sh** filter Nmap result; actually filtering like this can be done in Metasploit if you import the result to Metasploit
- **nmaptotal.sh** execute Nmap _killer scan_ by using `cexec`
- **switchip.sh** handy tool to switch (static) IP address by name


### More other utils

- **brute.py** brute force generator
- **Brute.groovy** brute force generator
- **pkcs5.py** PKCS#5 (PKCS#7) pad/unpad
- **sqldecipher.sh** SQLCipher decipherer


## License

The license is like Apache License v2.0, with addition that it must not be used for evil. So this collection is not really free to use/modify/distribute, because of that restriction :).
